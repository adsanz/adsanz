### `history | grep "Work exp: "`

####  **1. Work exp: Nokia**

Developed a *platform for students to get access to a virtual machine*. Acting as a **"middleware"** they request the lab from the moodle platform, which would trigger the lab env creation and access on a openstack cloud via the django platform (webhook). This platform will also allow the student the access via "apache guacamole".

There was an admin platform which allowed the teachers to give, revoke or list accesses. All this was backed with AD authentication. It was my first time working with Django, and even thought the platform worked, it was messy and required lots of fixes, this was done in 4 months (hackaton vibe tbh) Now I would opt for a REST API + Admin/student access front on another language. 

####  **2. Work exp: MrMilu**

Started of as a DevOps, managing the full lifecycle of a product, from the local development env, to staging, to production, covering backups, monitoring & security maintenance. Lately I've been working on a start-up project and I've worked on:
- **Cloud Arquitech**: Set-up with terraform (and previously pulumi to test both tools) a full and functional environment. We left out some elements like RDS since that was managed by Ansible playbooks on pipelines. Also I've created different cloud proposals for different clients 
- **Security testing**: Using burpsuite, guided with sonarqube, tried to perform different attacks to test out some SSO features which aid security on JWT tokens
- **SRE**: Monitoring with Prometheus suit (grafana, prom, exporters, loki, prom-executor, karma, alert-manager) the platform and get useful insights on about critical services like RDS, ElastiCache, EC2 instances, celery services. 
- **DevOps & SysOps**: Managed backups on 2 different regions with AWS backups, made a pipeline to execute datasync to get backups moved to Azure for disaster recovery. Configure & provision all envs with Ansible via pipelines on a custom gitlab runner set. 

#### **3. Work exp: Atalanta**

- **Senior DevSecOps** 
- worked on CICD for cloud native apps on AWS and migrated monolithic workloads managed via Ansible
- developed different scripts for Purple team operations
- worked with different clients to identify key points to migrate to DevOps culture
- Extras
-- Made my way to MorterueloCON 2023 demonstrating some of the flipper zero capabilities with Xtreme firmware
-- Did a talk on UAH (University of Alcala) about a example on how to simplify deployments to ECS using a docker compose extension + github actions and explaining cloud native workloads on ECS

### **4. Work exp: Cipher - resumed details**

- **Senior Tech Specialist (DevSecOps / System Arquitech / Python Dev)
- Develop a solution for CICD with Azure Devops
- Work on improve current system arquitechture 
- coordinate and manage migration to microservices

### `cat goals`

I'm aiming to be an expert on CiberSec someday, that has been my dream since I was 15 and I discovered Chema Alonso, but turns out I'm good as a DevOps, so I aim to be a "SecDevOps"
